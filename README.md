# Brian Schroeder Jr. - Portfolio

My name is Brian Schroeder Jr. and I currently live in Central California.

I have over 12+ years of experience in software development and web design.  My experience has been gained through education, employment in the financial industry, and through my current work with the judicial branch of the government.

I have a passion for creating useful and elegant software solutions that enhance user experiences and streamline business processes.  I have created front-end software using various technologies and worked on database back-ends to support developments and create reports for business needs.  I enjoy constantly learning about new and better ways to deliver products that meet the needs of the users that interact with them.

In my free time I enjoy cooking, golfing, playing video games, spending time with my family, and occasionally painting (both physical and digital) scenes like the digital painting on the background of this page!
